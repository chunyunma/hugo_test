Use `hugo new --kind rmd blog/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>` to create a new post(leaf) bundle.

Throughout this template, including the YAML, 
you should change "post-template" to the slug of your post, 
and "2019-06-04" to your publication date.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Options to have images saved in the post folder
# And to disable symbols before output
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=F, message=F, fig.path = "", comment = "")

# Knitr hook to use Hugo markdown render image
knitr::knit_hooks$set(plot = function(x,options) {
      base = knitr::opts_knit$get('base.url')
      if (is.null(base)) base = ''
      alt = ifelse (is.null(options$alt),"",options$alt)
      cap = ifelse (is.null(options$caption),"",options$caption)
      if (alt != ""){
        sprintf('![%s](%s%s "%s")', alt, base, x, cap)
      } else {
        sprintf('![%s](%s%s)', cap, base, x)  
        }
  })

# knitr hook to use Hugo highlighting options
knitr::knit_hooks$set(
  source = function(x, options) {
  hlopts <- options$hlopts
    paste0(
      "```r ",
      if (!is.null(hlopts)) {
      paste0("{",
        glue::glue_collapse(
          glue::glue('{names(hlopts)}={hlopts}'),
          sep = ","
        ), "}"
        )
      },
      "\n", glue::glue_collapse(x, sep = "\n"), "\n```\n"
    )
  }
)
```

The figure paths in the resulting Markdown will already be valid so you won't need to edit the Markdown file.

## Section heading in sentence case

Citation of the primary literature[^1]. 

Citation of a website[^2]. 

Citation of an R package[^3].

### Subsection heading

We recommend the use of [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) to include images, tweets, videos, gists, etc. In the Rmd file they need to be between `<!--html_preserve-->` and `<!--/html_preserve-->`.

**Add an image** by using markdown render hook.

![Label. This is the alternative text](name-of-image.png "Title")


Below is another image, a plot generated by a code chunk, so you might see how to add alternative text and other options in this case. You can also use [all options documented for the figure shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure) except for `src` that will be created automatically when knitting.

```{r chunkname, alt="Label. alternative text please make it informative", caption="this is what this image shows, write it here or in the paragraph after the image as you prefer"}
plot(1:10)
```

Once this file is knitted [the plot above](#label-figure) will be inserted with the correct syntax.

Make sure to append "-figure" to the ID in cross-reference, 
following the customized figure shortcode.


**Embed a tweet** by using a Hugo shortcode. 

<!--html_preserve-->
{{< tweet 1138216112808529920 >}}
<!--/html_preserve-->


**Tweak code highlighting** Below you can see how to use Hugo [Chroma code highlighting options](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlight-shortcode): highlight the 1st and 4th to 6th code lines, number lines as a table starting from 199.

```{r hl, hlopts = list(linenos='table',hl_lines='[1,"4-6"]',linenostart=199)}
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
a <- 1
```

**Add citation or footnote** text by using the format below
