## Preamble

Picture this: Joey owns an ice cream shop. The table below is a tabulation of daily temperature in July 2018 and the number of ice creams Joey sold on each day.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r sim-data, alt="Snapshot. a snapshot of the ice cream sale data", caption="Joey's ice cream sale in July 2018"}
set.seed(6)
x <- sample(20:35, 31, replace=T)
b0 <- 17
b1 <- 10
sigma <- 5.2
eps <- rnorm(x, 0, sigma)
y <- floor(b0 + b1*x + eps) ## Simulate ice cream sales 
icecream <- data.frame(x, y)
colnames(icecream) <- c('temp', 'icecream_sale')
icecream %>% slice_sample(n = 5)
```

### Let's plot the data!

```{r scatter, class="figure", alt="Sales. A scatter plot of icecream sales and daily temperature", caption="A scatter plot of icecream sales and daily temperature"}
(scatter_icecream <- ggplot(icecream, aes(x = temp, y = icecream_sale)) + geom_point(size = 2))
```

[Figure 1](#sales-figure) brings out a pattern otherwise hidden in the data; that is, the ice cream sales seem to increase as temperature increases. Although this type of relationship is very common, it implies a profound idea[^1]; **predict the unknown based on the known**. If the relationship between ice cream sales and temperature can be established, can we predict the ice cream sales on a given day based on its weather forecast? This predict-based-on-established-relationship is the essence of regression.

## Dive deeper

```{r regression}
reg_sale <- lm(icecream_sale ~ temp, data = icecream)
summary(reg_sale)
```

Let's take a look at residuals [^2]


```{r residuals, class="figure", alt="residuals in a regression model", caption="Residuals in a regression model"}
icecream$predicted <- predict(reg_sale)
icecream$residuals <- residuals(reg_sale)
ggplot(icecream, aes(x = temp, y = icecream_sale)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "lightgrey") +  # Plot regression slope
  geom_segment(aes(xend = temp, yend = predicted), alpha = .2) +  # alpha to fade lines
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(y = predicted), shape = 1) +
  theme_bw()
```


[^1]: This is another implicit assumption when we are conducting analyses like regression; what happened in the past will happen again in the future. This is a powerful and yet risky assumption.
